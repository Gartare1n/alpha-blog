# About alpha-blog(Complete)
Practice of creating a Blog with features:

* Simple home page

* Articles list

* Users list

* Users authentication, profiles, CRUD-operations with articles

* Some simple enhancement like hash-pass with bcrypt, validation with various flash-messages etc.


It's happened, I've finished working on it!!

# Many-to-Many and Tests
* Now starting to implement a many-to-many relationship(Users, Articles, Categories)
* Use all test types(Model, Integration, Functional)
